        <b>Design Process:</b>

        My first step when designing this visualization was to see how different types of charts interacted with my chosen dataset.
        I started with simple bar and scatterplots to get a firm understanding of how my data could be visualized. I then expanded two scatterplots, tweaking and updating along the way.</p>
        <div id="img">
        <img src="scatterplot.png" width="700px">
        <img src="scatterplot2.png" width="700px">
    </div>
    <p>
    After working with these two scatterplots, I found it difficult to display many different types of data with one visualization. Also, displaying data with scatterplots felt cluttered and was hard to gain any insights off of using the dataset that I selected.
    This is when I chose to switch to a barchart with a few added interactive features to display my dataset.
    I began my barchart by experimenting with displaying different attributes as height, width, and color. I soon found that age worked well as bar height, color worked well as outcome of diabetes,
     and width worked well to link blood pressure numbers with its corresponding bar.
    </p>

        <b>Rationale of Design Choices:</b>
        I chose this design because I believe it best displays important information when attempting to find correlations between diabetes and different tests. By showing positive and negative tests for diabetes as red and black, respectively,
         I believe it pulls the greatest attention to the most important factor. I chose to display the BMI numbers above the bars so that the viewer can compare numbers with the bars' height and color. Finally, I chose allow the user to sort the bars by glucose upon clicking on the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
        This visualization can be used to discover insights and answer questions on the relationship between diabetes and other factors. The most important factors when predicting outcome were glucose levels, BMI level, age, and outcome. This visualization can be manipulated to compare the data of multiple different test results and gain insights into identifying diabetes risk factors faster in the future.
